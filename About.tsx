                My focus lies in AI, Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and backend logic using SQL and Python. I enjoy working on projects that combine structured data, automation, and smart decision-making. I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always exploring technologies that blend logic and creativity â€” from database systems to cloud and cybersecurity fundamentals.

                When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into tech content or improving my soft skills. Beyond academics and tech, I enjoy reading books, trying out new things, and working on my fitness. I believe that it builds my discipline, focus, and balanced mindset.
